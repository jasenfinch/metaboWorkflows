# metaboWorkflows 0.9.5

* The correct sample information table is now exported for the pre-treated data.

# metaboWorkflows 0.9.4

* Plotting and summary targets added to the spectral processing module for profiling workflows.

* Script edited header added to generated `R/utils.R` file.

* Added the [`prettycode`](https://github.com/r-lib/prettycode) package to suggests.

# metaboWorkflows 0.9.3

* The workflow parallel options now set in `R/utils.R`.

* The targets `"transient"` memory option now set for all targets in `tar_options_set()` in `R/utils.R`.

* Updated the package [introduction vignette](https://jasenfinch.github.io/metaboWorkflows/articles/metaboWorkflows.html#the-project-directory-1) to include the setting of package options in `R/utils.R`.

# metaboWorkflows 0.9.2

* Renamed relevant targets with the prefixes `results` and `parameters`.

* R Markdown output report chunks now also include targets with the prefixes `results` and `parameters`.

* Captions for summary tables in R Markdown report output are generated from the target name.

* Modelling feature importance target now replaced by a modelling explanatory features target.

* Fixed typo in R Markdown report output footer.

* Project scripts generated by [`projecttemplates`]() and then edited by `metaboWorkflows` now include a header comment denoting the version of the package used.

* Targets for workflow modules now written to individual scripts within the project `R/targets` directory. 
These scripts are then sourced by `_targets.R`.

* Updated the usage vignettes with relevant changes.

# metaboWorkflows 0.9.1

* Added titles to supervised and unsupervised random forest MDS plots.

* [`rawrr`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rawrr.html) package now install now directed to Bioconductor for  [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) initialisation.

# metaboWorkflows 0.9.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

* A package website is now available at <https://jasenfinch.github.io/metaboWorkflows/>.

* The package can now be used to firstly define a workflow and then generate a project template directory that facilitates reproducible analysis powered by the use of [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) package, [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/), [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/).

* A choice of workflow data inputs are now available that include file paths and converted data file retrieval from a [`grover`](https://jasenfinch.github.io/grover/) web API.

* Workflows can be defined using [`defineWorkflow()`](https://jasenfinch.github.io/metaboWorkflows/reference/defineWorkflow.html) based the workflow input type and metabolomic technique, also enabling the selection of project template parameters.

* Workflow definitions can be modified which is detailed in the [Workflow customisation and extension](https://jasenfinch.github.io/metaboWorkflows/articles/workflow-customisation.html) vignette.

* Project directories for workflow definitions can be generated using [`generateWorkflow()`](https://jasenfinch.github.io/metaboWorkflows/reference/generateWorkflow.html).

* The [Introduction vignette](https://jasenfinch.github.io/metaboWorkflows/articles/metaboWorkflows.html) has been updated to detail the new package functionality.
